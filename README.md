# Deep Learning in Practice with Python and LUA - BMEVITMAV45 2024/25/1

The aim of the repository is to present our solution to the [ISIC2024 kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/isic-2024-challenge) implemented in the project homework. In the project, we have reviewed some literature and we plan to carry out this exercise based on our experience in other subjects.

## Project description

**Task description**: In this competition, we'll develop image-based algorithms to identify histologically confirmed skin cancer cases with single-lesion crops from 3D total body photos (TBP). The image quality resembles close-up smartphone photos, which are regularly submitted for telehealth purposes.

**Our approach**: We plan to explore classification by image alone, as well as classification by images and their associated metadata. We plan to use a pre-trained net for image processing and then fine tune it. We will use hyperparameter optimization to achieve the best model and find a solution for the unbalanced dataset. We plan to use [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) to build an AI service from it.
