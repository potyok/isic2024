# Deep Learning in Practice with Python and LUA - BMEVITMAV45 2024/25/1

The aim of the repository is to present our solution to the [ISIC2024 kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/isic-2024-challenge) implemented in the project homework. In the project, we have reviewed some literature and we plan to carry out this exercise based on our experience in other subjects.

## Project description

**Task description**: In this competition, we'll develop image-based algorithms to identify histologically confirmed skin cancer cases with single-lesion crops from 3D total body photos (TBP). The image quality resembles close-up smartphone photos, which are regularly submitted for telehealth purposes.

**Our approach**: We plan to explore classification by image alone, as well as classification by images and their associated metadata. We plan to use a pre-trained net for image processing and then fine tune it. We will use hyperparameter optimization to achieve the best model and find a solution for the unbalanced dataset. We plan to use [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) to build an AI service from it.

## Run

Load the isic_2024_data_prepare.ipynb and run all cells, if the original dataset is not available, you can download it from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11RQvjL61Ss2w2R1kKWHa2vdaJLdIGup6/view?usp=drive_link).

**We mostly used Jupyter Notebooks, so running them is very easy on a cell-by-cell basis.**

Load the isic_2024_baseline.ipynb and run all cells, to load data and train/test the baseline model. At the data loading you can set the hair_remove flag on data_module to use hair removal algorithm.

Load the isic_2024_alexnet_cross_validation.ipynb, isic_2024_combined_cross_validation.ipynb, isic_2024_custom_cross_validation.ipynb or isic_2024_mobilenet_v3_cross_validation.ipynb notebooks to train and cross validate models and test with test dataset.

### Gradio

To use Gradio, you need to save a trained model and place it in a location where it can be mounted to the Docker container.

Build container:

```
docker build -f gradio.dockerfile -t [IMAGE_NAME] .
```

Example for running container:

```
docker run --gpus all --rm -p 7860:7860 -v ./model:/app/model [IMAGE_NAME]
```

Due to its size, we managed to create a solution that runs on Huggingface, which is available [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Nemes2000/isic_2024).
